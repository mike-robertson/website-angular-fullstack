website-angular-fullstack
=========================
This is a sample personal website based off of the yeoman generator angular-fullstack. It uses the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node). Go to the angular-fullstack github page for a full explanation of how to deploy projects based off of their framework (using grunt). One thing to note, the seed file for the database has a default admin account, you may want to change this to your personal credentials or a more secure password before deploying live.
